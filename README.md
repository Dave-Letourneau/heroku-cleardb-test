# heroku-cleardb-test
A relatively short project to learn about connecting databases to web applications hosted on heroku.

This project is an attempt to combine several skills and tools I learned about in my Modern Web Apps class I took in the fall of 2016.
The goal is to create a website that is host on a cloud service (heroku) that allows the user to enter the name and description of an
item they would like to add to the database. I'll be using clearDB for the SQL Database on the heroku side, and will be building off
an old project from the class to get started.
